# Driver behavior Cluster
**Introduction**
<br/> In this project, we tried to create a statistical model to cluster driver behavior based on CAN Bus sensors data.
<br/> We will use Hierarchical clustering to identify and group the drivers based on their behavior and driving style. This identification of drivers can be used for improvements.

**Features**
<br/> id: identifier of the vehicle
<br/> odo: The odometer reading from the vehicle in km
<br/> dist: Driven distance during the time period.
<br/> fuelc: Total fuel consumption during report period while driving, idling and using a power take-off (litres).
<br/> idle: Engine running time in idle mode expressed as HH:MM:SS
<br/> pause: Engine running time with pause expressed as HH:MM:SS
<br/> fuelr: How many litres of fuel the vehicle or driver has consumed per 100 km.
